# chi-vs-flask

## Goal

Comparison of the same projects but written in different languages.

The project itself is a simple kinda-REST-like url shortener application.

The programs are written in Go using Chi module and in Python using Flask module.

In essence, we should conclude when and why we should use either tool as we examine their features and pitfalls in the development of url shortener.


## Words to mention

Altough the comparison might be unfair due to the specifics and narrow focus of such a simple web application, this simple project covers the majority of features developers use in larger projects but at a scale: routes, routers, middlewares, auth, body parsing, request and response handling, tests, database connector, utility functions, logging, schemas/interfaces, config setup, etc.

Nevertheless, it's a matter of taste despite the deep analysis conducted g O_o
